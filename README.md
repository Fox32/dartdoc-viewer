==========

The front-end Dart documentation viewer.

Here is how our tests are doing: [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/dart-lang/dartdoc-viewer/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/dart-lang/dartdoc-viewer/latest)

### Generating Files & Uploading to Cloud Storage

The viewer uses YAML files generated by the docgen package as the data being displayed. These files are stored in Google Cloud Storage.

 - Run `python uploadsdk.py` to generate these files and upload them to Cloud Storage as a new version.
- - -
These tasks can be done separately if necessary:

##### Generating YAML Files

YAML files can be generated using the docgen package in the dart repository. See the docgen documentation for more information on how to parse specific files and the Dart SDK.

##### Uploading to Cloud Storage

To push new files to Google Cloud Storage for use by the viewer, use the `gsutil` tool located at third_party/gsutil/gsutil in the Dart repository.

 - Run `python gsutil -m cp -q -a public-read -r <folder> gs://dartlang-docgen` to upload the specified folder to the viewer's bucket. Be sure to also upload a new VERSION file if the uploaded folder is to be used.**

**Note that the bucket contains several numbered folders for each version of the documentation. Run `python gsutil ls gs://dartlang-docgen` to see the file layout. Follow this convention and update a new VERSION file when uploading a new version of documentation. You can see the format of the VERSION file by running `python gsutil cat gs://dartlang-docgen/VERSION`.

### Running Locally

There are two ways to run the viewer locally:

 1. In the Dart Editor, the viewer can be run by running `dart client/build.dart` and then running index.html from the client/web/out/ folder. Be sure to have a working version of YAML documentation from the Generating YAML Files section above. These files should be put in a folder named 'docs' located in the client/ folder.
 2. Using the Google App Engine development server from the [Google App Engine SDK for Python][GAE], the viewer can be run by running `dev_appserver <folder containing app.yaml>`.

### Pushing to App Engine

Follow these steps to push to Google App Engine:

1. Download the [Google App Engine SDK for Python][GAE] and add it to your PATH.

2. Run `appcfg.py update <folder containing app.yaml>`.
